A simple todo-app concept with Pinia state management created using ChatGPT.
Since this app does not use local storage or database, selections are removed in each page refresh. 

While creating this concept, I faced an issue that is yet to be solved and would like to work on later. The issue is as below.
 
For the checkbox element, "@change" event produced expected result, but it later became reset. When "@click" event was used instead, the issue was resolved.
